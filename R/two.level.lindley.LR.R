#' Calculate the univariate LR
#'
#' Calculates the likelihood ratio for a univariate random effects with between
#' items modelled normal this is taken from Lindley's 1977 work and really forms
#' the precursor to the rest of this package REQUIRES control - a compitem
#' object calculated from the observations from the item considered to be the
#' control item - calculated from two.level.comparison.items() from the file
#' items_two_level.r recovered - a compitem object calculated from the
#' observations from the item considered to be the recovered item - calculated
#' from two.level.comparison.items() from the file items_two_level.r

#' @param control
#' @param recovered
#' @param background a compcovar object calculated from the observavions of the
#' population as a whole - calculated from the two.level.components() function
#' from the file components_two_level.r RETURNS LR - an estimate of the
